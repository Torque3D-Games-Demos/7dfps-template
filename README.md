# 7DFPS Template

This year, for 7DFPS, I decided to create a 'template game' for Torque 3D to provide a nicer alternative to the stock Full template.
You can read my [initial announcement][] and find more details at the project's [wiki page][].
My goals are:

 * Modern FPS gameplay like ironsights and melee attacks
 * Single-player/co-op mission
 * A simple flat-shaded/toon art style
 * A library of example weapons
 * Simple AI
 * Vehicles
 * Full controller support
